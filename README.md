Gogs is a painless self-hosted Git service. (https://gogs.io/). 

The goal of this project is to make the easiest, fastest,
 and most painless way of setting up a self-hosted Git service.
 With Go, this can be done with an independent binary distribution 
 across ALL platforms that Go supports, including Linux, Mac OS X, Windows and ARM.

 
I realy appreciate them for their usefull project. We used it in many proejects. 
This repo tries to gather some required features and scripts.

I will update this repo frequently.

 - `gogs-list.sql` is a simple SQL query which lists all open issues with repository names and labels.
 - `gogs.css` is a draft of css file for RTL view and Using a Nice Persian Font (IRANSans).
		Dont forget tp replace this font (By a free one) or buy the liscence. Replace this file in `public/css` folder
